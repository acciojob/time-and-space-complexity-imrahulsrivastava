            When analyzing algorithms, we often encounter the concept of <em>time complexity</em>. Time complexity measures how the execution time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input data increases. In other words, it tells us how efficient an algorithm is in terms of its time consumption. An algorithmwith better time complexity takes less time to execute for larger inputs, making it more desirable in practice.

            <b>Space Complexity</b> is another crucial aspect to consider. It refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm uses to solve a problem as a function of the input size. In computer science, we commonly use the big O notation to express space complexity. For example, if an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the amount of memory it uses grows linearly with the input size. Managing space complexity is essential to avoid memory-related issues and ensure efficient memory usage.
